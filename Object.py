#Object
'''
It has been agreed that in Python everything is an object. In fact, Python is an object-oriented language.

Objects are instances of classes. For example, when you create a variable with a string, you are creating a string object.

Objects have attributes (characteristics) and methods (actions that can be applied).

Notice how to check attributes and methods to an object:

object.attribute
object.method( )
